# mujoco-wasm-forge

Standardized, reproducible build pipeline for compiling MuJoCo to WebAssembly. This repository focuses solely on producing versioned WASM artifacts from MuJoCo tags.

This repository is a fork/continuation of MuJoCo WASM efforts by stillonearth, zalo, and hashb. We acknowledge and build upon their ideas and prior work in the MuJoCo â†’ WebAssembly space.

- Input: MuJoCo tag (e.g., v3.2.5, v3.3.7)
- Output: dist/mujoco-{version}.{js,wasm,wasm.map}, ersion.json
- Fixed toolchain: pinned Emscripten; Qhull/LFS disabled; libccd static; no rendering

See docs/DEV_NOTES.md for the end-to-end plan across Repo A (build), Repo B (glue), and Repo C (apps).

Status: experimental. The initial content migrates the ad-hoc scripts from sik-wasm/local_tools/mujoco_web_research into this repo.
